
BrainFuck compiler 1.0 for MSX-DOS Made By: NYYRIKKI 2002
---------------------------------------------------------

This BrainFuck compiler will compile all BF sources written to original 8bit BrainFuck.

Usage:
------

BF8 <InputFile> [<OutputFile>] [/N] [/I] [/O] [/C]

    /N	No compile
	Using /N will cause source (inputfile) to be optimized without compilation. This will also
	remove all comments from source. If outputfile is defined then source will be written to it.
	Otherwise source will be printed to screen.

    /I	Input trough MSX BIOS
	If /I parameter is found compiler will use MSX BIOS input routine instead of CP/M input.
	If you use /I characters will not be ehcoed to screen on input. This parameter will disable
	CP/M compatibility.

    /O	Output trough MSX BIOS
	If /O parameter is found compiler will use MSX BIOS output routine instead of CP/M input.
	Using /O will increase execution speed and change VT-52 to MSX console support.
	This parameter will disable CP/M compatibility.

    /C  Disable CR/LF fix
	BF programs should print CR+LF to make linefeed. As all sources does not anyway do that,
	this compiler is made to fix this problem by default. If some program anyway needs to use
	CR or LF to some other purpose than pure linefeed you should disable CR/LF fix.

If source is compiled and output file is not defined program will automaticly start compiled program. Please note, that compiled program is speed optimized for Z80 and so it does not have any runtime error detection. User should take care, that sourcecode is valid.


Compiler errors:
----------------

    Unbalanced brackets

	This error will be given by compiler if amount of "[" and "]" is not equal in the code.
	In case of this error program will not automaticly run.

    Error while opening source file.

	File was not found or there was disk error.

    Error while writing destination file.

	Disk is write protected, disk is full or disk has errors on it.
