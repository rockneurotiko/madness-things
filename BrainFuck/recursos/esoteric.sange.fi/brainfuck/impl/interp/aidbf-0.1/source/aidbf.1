Without any options aidbf will execute all brain fuck programs specified.
You can change some runtime behaviours using the options above. Use the
randomize and seed options to random initialize the data segment before
execution. Use the inputmode option to switch between various input modes.
Finally you can use the debug and break options to debug your brain fuck
programs. Use the help command in the debugger to get a short but sufficient
usage help.
