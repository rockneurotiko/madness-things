Installation of mod_bf
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Sorry, I don't have any experience with Apache 2.0, yet. Installing this module
probably takes different steps.

Installing this module really shouldn't be hard.
All you should have to do are the following steps, if something doesn't
work, please send an email to <markus.kliegl@t-online.de> with a detailed
description of the problem.

1. Untar mod_bf-xxx.tar.gz into <apache>/src/modules, where <apache> is the
   directory that contains the sources of apache. This should create the directory
   <apache>/src/modules/bf.
2. Add the following line to the end of the <apache>/src/Configuration file:
   AddModule modules/bf/mod_bf.o
3. Now cd into <apache>/src and run './Configure'. This should create a Makefile
   in <apache>/src/modules/bf.
4. Now you can proceed with the apache installation just as you normally would, just
   adding the following
   --activate-module=src/modules/bf/libbf.a
   when calling './configure'.

In order to be able to make use of mod_bf, you will have to do one of the following:

A. Edit <apache-dst>/conf/httpd.conf and add the following line at the appropriate
   section:
   AddHandler bf-handler .bf
   <apache-dst> is here where the installed apache server resides. This will let
   mod_bf handle all requests on files with the ending '.bf'.
B. Create a directory, such as <apache-dst>/htdocs/bf and create a file called
   .htaccess in the newly created directory. Edit this file to contain the same
   line as above 'AddHandler bf-handler .bf'. This will pass all requests on files
   with the extension .bf that are located in the directory to mod_bf. It should be
   noted that you might just as well add the above line to a .htaccess in any other
   directory.

Everything should be configured, now go ahead and test it. :-)
