mod_bf - brainfuck module for Apache
====================================

I am quite sure this module will only work with Apache 1.3 and up, but I doubt
anyone uses an older Apache version anymore, anyway ;-)

For instructions on how to install this module, see the file named INSTALL.
To see the license, have a look at the file named COPYING.

For resources brainfuck in general, see http://www.muppetlabs.com/~breadbox/bf/
and the links listed there.

Using mod_bf
~~~~~~~~~~~~
Once you have everything installed and configured as in INSTALL, you should be
able to start using mod_bf. A file test.bf containing ,. will print one character
of its input. To use it you must call it like this:
http://www.somehost.bla/some/dir/test.bf?A
where A can just as well be any other letter.

You may also call a brainfuck file that doesn't need input like this:
http://www.somehost.bla/some/dir/some_file.bf.

mod_bf (since v0.2) supports the POST method as well.
