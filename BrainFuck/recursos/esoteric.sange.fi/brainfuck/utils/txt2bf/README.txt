Currently converts ASCII text in a file to brainfuck code
in a file with the extension .bf  The output code is fairly
well optimised with respect to size, using loops generated from the
factors of the difference between the value of the current ascii char
and the value of the next ascii char.

Run make to compile, the txt2bf <inputfile> to convert a file to bf.

The resulting output has been tested with "bfi" the Brainf*ck
interpreter.
