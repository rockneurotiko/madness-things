BF compiler/interpreter (BF was created by Urban Mueller) 
Programmed by Jeffry Johnston, March 2001

Here are a couple of tiny BF executables.  Please let me know if you can make
them smaller!

BF Compiler     BFC2.COM, BFC2.ASM      123 bytes
-------------------------------------------------
Usage: BFC2.COM < sourcefile > outputfile.com
Note that the sourcefile must contain an "@" character at the end. 

BF Interpreter  BFI2.COM, BFI2.ASM      98 bytes
------------------------------------------------
Usage: COPY BFI2.COM + sourcefile outputfile.com /B

Have fun,
